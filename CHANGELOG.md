# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Re-split Backdrop segments after every background switch: `backdrop-split`
  runs after `omarchy theme bg set` in `applyCurrentMode` and
  `applyBackground` (`bg set` fires no theme-set hook, so segments would
  otherwise keep showing the previous background). Guarded — a missing or
  failing splitter never fails a theme apply.
- External theme/profile setters on the `esemczak.theme-modes` IPC target for
  dotfiles convergence: `setLightTheme`, `setDarkTheme`, `selectProfile`
  (each returns the resulting state value). Joins `toggleMode`,
  `nextProfile`/`previousProfile`, `followAutomatic`, `refreshThemes`, `status`.

### Security

- Add descriptor-safe I/O core: held directory fds, bounded read loops, verified-image cache materialization
- Read theme names from child stdout incrementally in binary mode with deadline and byte ceilings

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-29

### Security

- Enforce strict theme slug allowlist before shell commands and path construction
- Read plugin state and current theme through no-follow regular-file helpers with byte limits
- Write plugin state atomically via verified private-directory helper
- Cap catalog helper stdout, terminate stalled processes, and verify image paths under anchored roots before QML use

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Bar widget with tabbed panel: General, Light themes, Dark themes
- Separate light and dark theme presets with per-mode background selection
- Infinite theme carousel with size-based selection and floating nav orbs
- Panel background preview from the active theme/background
- Manual light/dark switching and automatic mode (schedule or battery)
- Battery rule info card (dark on battery, light on power)
- Right-click bar icon to toggle modes; middle-click to follow automatic
- IPC target `esemczak.theme-modes` for shell integration
- Root `preview.png` for marketplace listings
- Real desktop screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`
- Publishing documentation: install, remove, dependencies, security notes

### Notes

- Theme and background are configured through this plugin's panel, not Omarchy's native switchers
- Plugin state is stored in `~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/theme-modes.json`
- No global hooks, polling, or system-wide configuration required
